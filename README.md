This plugin template uses Typescript and NPM, two standard tools in creating JavaScript applications.

First, download Node.js which comes with NPM. This will allow you to install TypeScript and other
libraries. You can find the download link here:

  https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Next, install TypeScript using the command:

  npm install -g typescript

Finally, in the directory of your plugin, get the latest type definitions for the plugin API by running:

  npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings
